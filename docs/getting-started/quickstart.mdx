This quickstart guide will help you build your first project using skypy-db.

**Two steps**: Installation → building

## Step 1: Installation

### Prerequisites

**Environment**

- Python 3.11 or later

**API Keys Features**

This quickstart uses three API endpoints to build any project:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
    <Card
        title="Add"
        icon="plus"
        href="https://ahen.mintlify.app/api-guides/endpoint/add">
      Add data to the database using the API endpoints.
    </Card>
    <Card
        title="Delete"
        icon="trash"
        href="https://ahen.mintlify.app/api-guides/endpoint/delete">
      Delete data from the database using the API endpoints.
    </Card>
    <Card
        title="Get"
        icon="search"
        href="https://ahen.mintlify.app/api-guides/endpoint/get">
      Retrieve data from the database using the API endpoints.
    </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Setup

- install dependencies

```bash
pip install skypydb
```

## Step 2: Building

- add a data to the database using the API endpoints.

```python
# Add data to a table.
table.add(
    title=["document"],
    user_id=["user123"],
    content=["this is a document"],
    id=["auto"]# ids are automatically created by the backend.
)
```

- delete a data from the database using the API endpoints.

```python
# delete data on the table assuming they are already in the table.
table.delete(
    title=["document"],
    user_id=["user123"],
    content=["this is a document"],
)
```

- search data from the database using the API endpoints.

```python
# Search results. search data assuming they are already in the table. You can also search the data by the id of the document
results = table.search(
    index="user123",# search the corresponding data by their index
    title=["document"]# search the corresponding data by their title
    #id=["***"]
)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```
